This contains a VERY simple password checker.

This program will take input from the user and judge how secure a password is by its composition. 
Currently, there is a limited definition of what is considered to be a strong password.
A strong password consists of: 
A password length must be equal to/more than 8 characters
Posses 1 special character, number, and capital letter.

To run the program, have a traditional IDE installed that can run c# code such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, Eclipse, etc.

Ethical Concern(s): 
	You are free to modify the code as you see fit, however only modify the code to give much more secure passwords.
Do not modify this code base to return passwords that are subpar or worse, and passing them off to the user as secure passwords. Peoples
livelihoods have been axed due something as simple as a weak password.
